# Writing Proposals in "Problem, Diagnosis, Remedy" Style

"PDR style", as I call it, is a way of structuring a proposal that encourages the author to break the proposal summary into three short sections so that the summary is more easily digestable by executives and other decision makers.

I was introduced to this structure in 2009 or 2010 by Raul Valdes-Perez, who was CEO of [Viv√≠simo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivisimo) at the time. He preferred it and taught it to those who sought his official input on a matter. I took it a little further and include my full investigation, research, and recommendations in the document while maintaining the digestible summary.

Included in this repository is [Leslie Lamport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport)'s essay, _State the Problem Before Describing the Solution_, a seminal work in the computer science field. I discovered it 10+ years after formalizing this template and its recommendations are core to the workflow the template provides.

Also included in [`template-adr.md`](template-adr.md) is a barebones template for an [Architecture Decision Record](https://adr.github.io/) that includes the PDR format _inside of_ the [Nygard format for ADR](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions.html). I've used this template with great success more than a dozen times!
