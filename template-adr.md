## Context

<!-- Summarize the summary and recommended action in one or two sentences -->

### Executive Summary

#### Problem

<!-- Describe the problem in concrete terms. Be factual, cite data but do not explain the data: that goes in the Research and Exploration section. Keep this problem description succinct and free of opinionated language. Examples: "I am lightheaded." "Code Reviews are open for weeks without comments, approvals, or merges." -->

I observed that…

#### Diagnosis

<!-- Describe what your research leads you to believe is the problem. Do not describe secondary problems or suggest resolutions to individual diagnoses: those go in the other sections. Example: "I am bleeding." "The team does not prioritize reviewing and instead prefers to generate new code until blocked." -->

My observation and research lead me to believe that…

#### Remedy

<!-- Summarize the realistic options presented herein but always highlight the recommended course of action. Ideally, this whole executive summary section could be read as three sentences. Example: "I should apply a bandage." "The team should set aside the first 30 minutes of their day to conduct reviews, skipping this time block only when there are no reviews to be done." -->

My research leads me to recommend that…

### Discussion

#### Current State

<!-- Describe in as much detail as necessary the current state of the world. Describe the problem and its effects on schedules, timelines, budgets, sanity, and more. Focus on risks and uncertainty that cause this to be a problem worth fixing. -->

Currently, …

#### Desired State

<!-- Describe in as much detail as necessary the desired state after any proposed remedy is applied. All remedies should achieve this goal but perhaps vary in the three categories: cost, speed, and correctness. Those remedies should not be outlined here. -->

Any proposed solution will…

#### Research and Exploration

<!-- 
This is the meat of the document.
Explore solutions in-depth, outline what you've looked into and rejected as well as what's possible.
-->

#### Options

<!-- Summarize possible solutions here. One option should always be "do nothing" and explain the ramifications of inaction. Always list these by number so that they can be easily referenced in the summary and in subsequent discussion.-->

These are the options to reach an outcome that achieves the desired state.

1. Do nothing.
2. …

#### Summary

<!-- Use this section to describe the problem, its cause, and your recommended remedy, referencing the option number from the options section. -->

In summary, X causes a problem. I recommend option #3 because it is the perfect balance of speed, cost, and correctness.

## Decision

Whereas:

<!-- Summarize the problems, dependencies, etc. -->

Be it resolved:

<!-- List the actions that will happen upon Acceptance -->

## Consequences

<!-- List *all* possible side effects and people who you know should be notified of the change. -->
